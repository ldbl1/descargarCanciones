## Why

My wedding is in a few months and the restaurant I'm celebrating, needs me to give them a usb drive with all the songs whose I want to party. 
So, after years of paying for Spotify subscription, i decided to use "my right to listen to music" with this little script after I've tryed to download it from all over internet and not been able to download any music.

## Disclaimer

This script does not want to let people do any illegal actions, but to give them some tools to work with YouTube. 
Any illegal use of my script is not my responsibility.

## How to use it

First, and logically, you need to have python installed.
Later, make sure you have pip installed.

To make sure you have all seted up, execute this two commands on a CDM

`pyton -version`

You should have an output like this

`Python 3.8.10`

Any version above this is also valid.

---

To make sure you have pip installed, try this command

`pip -V` (make sure the V is uppercase)

You should have an output like this. 

`pip 22.1.2 from (...)`

---

After this, you can install the two libraries needed with this two commands:

`pip install youtube_dl`

`pip install easygui`

`pip install colorama`

## Configuration for executing

You'll need:
* One folder to save all your songs
* CSV file with any header, only one column and all the urls, listed and separated with \r\n

The csv file must have only 1 column and have a header with any name on it

The urls must have only the url to make it work
